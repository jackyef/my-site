This page lists the things that I use in my daily life. It is not exhaustive by
any means. I only include things that I think are noteworthy. This page also
serves as a my personal reference as well, in case I need to redo my setup in
the future OR upgrade in the future.

## Hardwares

### Computers üñ•Ô∏è

1. Windows 10 PC

   - CPU: Intel i5-12400
   - Memory: 64 GB DDR4
   - SSD: Samsung EVO 970 Plus

   This PC started off as my gaming PC to unwind after work. In mid 2022, I
   decided to upgrade it and run Ubuntu in WSL2 on it. My development workflow
   involves running a lot of Docker containers and running them on Mac wasn't a
   pleasant experience. I now run Docker on this PC with WSL2 backend, while
   still mostly writing code on my MacBook via SSH. I wrote about how to go
   about setting it up in
   [`wsl2-as-devbox`](https://github.com/jackyef/wsl2-as-devbox).

2. MacBook Pro 2020 - i7 32GB/1TB

   This is the MacBook that I've been developing with. It is plenty fast for web
   development, until you need to run Docker on it. I spent the extra money to
   get 32GB/1TB for future-proofing. Now that I have Docker running on my PC, I
   might just get a less powerful laptop next time I replace my laptop.

### Displays üì∫

I am using a
[27-inch Dell](https://www.dell.com/en-lt/work/shop/cty/pdp/spd/dell-u2721de-monitor)
as my primary display and a
[21-inch Acer](https://www.acer.com/ac/en/HK/content/model/UM.WE1CF.001) as a
secondary. I really like the Dell as it can connect to my Mac via USB-C, which
makes things easier. It also acts as an USB hub when connected this way.

## Software üìã

### Terminal

I use [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) on Mac and
[Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) on my Windows PC. Both
are set up with [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) just because it
comes with some quality of life improvements out-of-the-box, 2 of my most
favorite one being `git` aliases and not having to type `cd` everytime üòÑ.

I don't have a lot of customization in the `.zshrc` file, here is the addition I
have to the default `.zshrc`:

```shell
# Adds docker-compose plugin
# Allows for aliases like: dce, dcup, dcdn, dclf, etc.
plugins=(git docker-compose)

# Aliasing gpuo because I find myself doing this quite often.
alias gpuo="git push -u origin"

# Customizing prompt so I know I am currently in an SSH session in my WSL2 instance
# I only do this on my WSL2 instance
PROMPT="%{$fg[green]%}%n@%{$fg[cyan]%}%m%{$reset_color%} ${PROMPT}"

# Adding paths to the binaries I use

# nvm (should be added automatically by nvm on install)
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # This loads nvm bash_completion

# go
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
# yarn
export PATH="$PATH:$(yarn global bin)"
```

### Code editor

I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Unfortunately I just
never got into using [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) üòÖ

VSCode has excellent SSH and WSL support which makes everything very seamless
even when coding from different computers. One day, I might even
[set up VSCode server](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2viJSYyKio) so I can
code from my iPad.

Some extensions that I install on VSCode:

1. [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
2. [Docker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker)
3. [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
4. [GitHub (yes, the deprecated one)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=KnisterPeter.vscode-github)
5. [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)
6. [Remote - SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh)
7. [:emojisense:](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.emojisense)
8. [styled-jsx](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=blanu.vscode-styled-jsx),
   when I am working on codebase that uses it
9. [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss),
   also when I am working on codebase that uses it

### Web browsers

I use [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) as my primary web browser. On
Mac, I also use
[Arc, a browser by The Browser Company](https://thebrowser.company/) for web
sites/apps that I tend to keep open for a longer time.
[I tweeted about how I am using Arc a while back](https://twitter.com/jackyef__/status/1546745567455629314).

### Some notable web apps

1. [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), for note-taking and personal journal.
2. [GitHub](https://github.com), I have a private repo named `growth` on GitHub
   where I put technical things that I plan to learn/do for self-improvement.
3. [Cal.com](https://cal.com), the scheduling infrastructure that I use on
   [/chat](/chat).
4. [omatsuri.app](https://omatsuri.app/), various handy tools for web
   development.

### Some handy Mac apps

1. [Pandan](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pandan/id1569600264?mt=12), I use
   Pandan to alert me every 20 minutes, after which I will take a short break to
   avoid me sitting and staring at the computer for too long.
2. [Hand Mirror](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hand-mirror/id1502839586?mt=12),
   a handy app to give myself a quick access to the webcam.
3. [Gifox](https://gifox.io/), my go-to app to record a short GIF.
4. [Cron](https://cron.com/), a simply better calendar experience (also
   available on Windows!)
