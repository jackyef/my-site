        I am a software engineer working on all-things-web. I am a curious
        person and I love to learn how things work. It gives me a satisfying
        feeling when I discover the reasons why some things are made the way
        they are.

        Most of my experience are with React and front-end development. I work
        on both infrastructure and product side of the frontend work. I like to
        strengthen fundamentals and concepts to allow me to learn other things
        easier, even when they may not be necessarily closely related to
        front-end development. Feel free to{' '}

        team, working on things that help other developers in their work such
        as: development tools, CIs, and monitoring tools. I also tinkered around
        with build processes and maintained Tokopedia&apos;s web platform
        monorepo that housed 20+ services and 30+ reusable packages to which 80+
        developers were contributing daily.

        a timely manner.
