{/* !start-of-preview */}

This page shows some of the design tokens used on this site. Specifically about
the colors, I do not define color scales, but I do have some base colors from
which I tweak to make custom components like buttons.

{/* !end-of-preview */}

## Surfaces

There are 6 surfaces ranging from 0 to 5 which denotes how elevated that surface
is. Since they do not need to be highly dynamic, they are defined in the
`tailwind.config.js` file. Each surface ( `bg-surface-n`) is made to be paired
with its shadow ( `shadow-surface-n`).

Surface 1 is the _default_ surface, which is a surface that lies flat on the
page, which means it does not have a shadow.

<Surfaces />

## Colors

Most colors used on this site is derived from the following base colors. Some
hue rotation, saturation and lightness adjusting is done when needed to build a
specific component.

<Colors />

As an example, consider the following buttons and the css used to build it.

<div className={cn('flex flex-wrap space-x-4')}>
  <LightButton variant="primary">primary</LightButton>
  <LightButton variant="secondary">secondary</LightButton>
</div>

```tsx
export const LightButton = ({
  variant = 'primary',
  className,
  ...props
}: Props) => {
  const base = css`
    color: ${getHslaColor(variant, 1, { l: -12 })};

    [data-theme='dark'] & {
      color: ${getHslaColor(variant)};
    }

    background: ${getHslaColor(variant, 0.1)};
    border-color: ${getHslaColor(variant)};
    border-radius: 4rem;

    &:hover,
    &:focus {
      background: ${getHslaColor(variant, 0.08)};
    }
  `;

  return (
    <button className={cn(base, 'px-4', 'py-2', className)} {...props} />
  );
};
```

## Other tokens

Other tokens such as text size, spacing, etc. are following `tailwindcss`
tokens.

## Reasons for this approach

I initially started working on this site and fully rely on `tailwindcss` for the
styling part. After some time, I started realizing that because I treat my site
as a personal playground to try various things, I tend to be very dynamic in
making styles. While I can definitely update tailwind configuration to
accommodate this use cases, there are problems with that approach.

1. It's annoying to have to update `tailwind.config.js` everytime I need to do
   this
2. Using `tailwindcss`, we can support dark mode but not multiple themes at
   once; this is something I plan to do in the future.
3. The resulting `.css` is never codesplitted. This can result in big stylesheet
   as I add more different styles.

My current approach is to still rely on `tailwindcss` classes for most basic
spacing and layout styles that aren't as dynamic as colors. For colors and other
things that might be more dynamic, I derive them on runtime from a set of css
variables.

Do note that this is most definitely not the best way to do things, but hey,
software engineering is about making tradeoffs. This solution seems to work well
enough for me, at least for now. üòÑ
