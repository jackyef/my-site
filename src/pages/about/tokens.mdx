This page shows some of the design tokens I am using here on this site.
Specifically about the colors, I do not define color scales, but I do have some
base colors from which I tweak to make custom components like buttons.

## Surfaces

There are 6 surfaces ranging from 0 to 5 which denotes how elevated that surface
is. Since they do not need to be highly dynamic, they are defined in the
`tailwind.config.js` file. Each surface ( `bg-surface-n`) is made to be paired
with its shadow ( `shadow-surface-n`).

Surface 1 is the _default_ surface, which is a surface that lies flat on the
page, which means it does not have a shadow.

<Surfaces />

## Colors

Most colors used on this site is derived from the following base colors. Some
hue rotation, saturation and lightness adjusting is done when needed to build a
specific component.

<Colors />

As an example, consider the following buttons and the css used to build it.

<div className={clsx('flex flex-wrap space-x-4')}>
  <LightButton variant="primary">primary</LightButton>
  <LightButton variant="secondary">secondary</LightButton>
</div>

```tsx
export const LightButton = ({
  variant = 'primary',
  className,
  ...props
}: Props) => {
  const base = css`
    color: ${getHslaColor(variant, 1, { l: -12 })};

    [data-theme='dark'] & {
      color: ${getHslaColor(variant)};
    }

    background: ${getHslaColor(variant, 0.1)};
    border-color: ${getHslaColor(variant)};
    border-radius: 0.5rem;

    &:hover,
    &:focus {
      background: ${getHslaColor(variant, 0.08)};
    }
  `;

  return (
    <button className={clsx(base, 'px-4', 'py-2', className)} {...props} />
  );
};
```
