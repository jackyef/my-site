Hey! ðŸ‘‹

This document serves as a user guide to me. 
It speaks about my values and how they translate into how I work as a human.
I am not saying I fully embody all of these values all the time, but I always try my best to do so.
Hopefully, it will help us better understand each other and thus work together better.

Humans change, largely affected by time and situation they are in. As such, this is a living document
that will also change over time as I grow as well. I will try to keep this updated as much as possible.
With that being said, I believe much of the core values will remain the same.

I would appreciate feedback on this document. If you have any, please do not hesitate to [reach out to me](https://twitter.com/jackyef__).

## My view on things

*__I appreciate honesty and transparency__* â€” I think honesty and transparency are foundation of trust. 
The more we open up to each other, the better we can understand each other. This helps us to work better together,
because we would be less likely to make assumptions that may be counterproductive. We do not have to be open about 
things we are not comfortable with (i.e.: personal stuff), but we should be open about things that affect our work.
For instance, openly giving feedback is very important to me, especially if done with good intention.

*__I value integrity highly__* â€” It is very hard for me to work with people I do not trust. I believe trust is built by
showing integrity consistently over time. Integrity can be shown on following through on the words we made, having the humility to 
admit mistakes, not doing unethical things, and many others. I will try my best to do that to earn your trust. I hope you do the same.

*__I understand that work is just a part of life__* â€” I believe most people work to live, not live to work. I do understand some 
people are very passionate about their work and dedicate their life entirely to it. I respect that, but I'd like to think that that isn't the majority.
If something happens in your life that affects your work, I will try to be understanding and accommodating. I hope to be treated the same. I believe people who are 
fulfilled with their life outside of work are more likely to be a better to work with as well. It's a win-win situation for everyone.

*__I believe in async work__* â€” I trust that we are all responsible adult who can manage our own time. Excluding 
synchronous meetings where we are expected to show up, I do not think we need to be online all the time. I believe asynchronous way
of communicating works better in the long term. When given time to write down our thoughts, we can iterate on them and make them better.
This helps us all to be a better communicator and the writing also serves as a documentation that we can look back to. Obviously, 
I would adhere to the team's culture and norms, but where possible, I would prefer async communication. I believe async work also 
helps with people achieving a better work-life balance.

*__I assume good intent, until you give me reason to think otherwise__* â€” I do not like to make bad assumptions about people. 
There is no way to know if the assumptions are true and it is not productive to try to find out. I assume you do not 
have malicious intent when working with me, until you give me reason to think otherwise. I hope you do the same for me.
If I have a reasonable basis for doubting your intent, I will be honest and transparent and ask you about it directly.
If I ever do that, the reason is so that we can both clear up any misunderstandings we might have, or simply better understand 
about the things that make us not work well together.

*__I do not tolerate passive aggresiveness__* â€” If you have reason to be upset with me, I would appreciate if you can talk to me directly about it.
If I have been a jerk towards you, I apologize sincerely. I would not want us to have reasons to be aggressive towards each other for too long.
It is not health for both of us and for the team we are working with. No one wins.

*__I do not usually talk unless asked to__* â€” I am highly introverted. I also do not like to be the one to give unsolicited feedback.
I try to be more proactive in appropriate situations, but in most other cases I just simply do not talk unless asked. Even then, I would 
usually answer the question in a pretty straightforward way. So, yes/no questions aren't the way to get me talking much, but if you ask me 
questions about my opinion on something, I would be more than happy to share. I don't generally feel bothered when people ask me questions, so please do not hesitate to ask.

*__I am not afraid to say no__* â€” Do not be afraid to ask me anything. I will try to help when I can, but I will 
also tell you no when I cannot. I like to do this to remove any ambiguity and to set the right expectation. Some people might be
reluctant to ask because they don't want to be a bother. I will tell you directly when it is not a good time for me to help out and 
tell you no, so you don't have to worry about being a bother. I hope you do the same for me.

*__I believe we should try to get better at our work__* â€” I understand that life gets in the way and we might not have the
time to keep up with the latest and greatest. I do not think we can be expert at everything, but we should strive to 
be better compared to our past self. We might not always improve day-to-day, heck we might even regress at times, but the trend should 
hopefully be moving upwards. I believe that we work better when we want to get better, compared to when we are just doing it for the sake of doing it.

*__I believe helping others is how we make impact__* â€” I understand there are high-level metrics that businesses usually use to measure impact,
but often times I cannot relate to them easily. OKRs and KPIs can be useful, but the moment they become the only thing that matters, I feel like
it is a sign that things might be going south. I have seen people and teams within one same organization develops a cutthroat culture for the sake of 
KPIs/OKRs and I think it becomes counterproductive. When in doubt, I default to helping others as a way to make impact. I try to 
think about how I can make things easier for people. Improving processes, writing documentation, and sharing knowledge are some of the ways I try to do that.

*__I appreciate affirmation__* â€” I am not a very confident person. I often second-guess myself and my work. Eventhough I try
to be upfront towards people, I sometimes worry that people might not be honest with me. I appreciate affirmation from people
I worked with. It helps me to confirm where I have done well and where I can improve. I will try to do the same for you.

*__I might use words that meant something I do not mean__* â€” English isn't my first language. I largely learned it from 
watching TV shows and movies, and also reading. A lot of my vocabularies are learned by deriving the meaning from the context.
In some cases, the meaning I derived might not be the same as the actual meaning, causing confusion when I use the phrase with
actual people. If you ever feel confused about what I said, please do assume I do not have any ill intention and ask me to clarify. I will try my best to explain and learn 
the correct meaning for the next time.
