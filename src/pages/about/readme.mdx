Hey! ðŸ‘‹

This document serves as a user guide for me. 
It speaks about my values and how they may affect how I work as a human.
I am not saying I fully embody all of these values all the time, but I always try my best to do so.
Hopefully, it will help us better understand each other and thus work together better.

Some of the things here might be specific to my current role/job/situation.

Humans change, largely affected by time and the situation they are in. As such, this is a living document
that will also change over time as I grow as well. I will try to keep this updated as much as possible.
With that being said, I believe many of the core values will remain the same.

I would appreciate feedback on this document. If you have any, please do not hesitate to [reach out to me](https://twitter.com/jackyef__).

## My view on things

*__I appreciate honesty and transparency__* â€” I think honesty and transparency are the foundation of trust. 
The more we open up to each other, the better we can understand each other. This helps us to work better together
because we would be less likely to make assumptions that may be counterproductive. We do not have to be open about 
things we are not comfortable with (i.e.: personal stuff), but we should be open about things that affect our work.
For instance, openly giving feedback is very important to me, especially if done with good intentions.

*__I long for clarity__* â€” I believe we work better when we are in sync. I try to be as clear as possible when communicating 
my thoughts, which oftentimes leads to lengthy messages. I am learning to be more concise while still being clear. If I have doubts,
I will always ask for clarification. Do not hesitate to ask me to clarify things as well. It is not a bother, rather it will 
help me to better understand how I can communicate better in the future.

*__I value integrity__* â€” It is very hard for me to work with people I do not trust. I believe trust is built by
showing integrity consistently over time. Integrity can be shown by following through on the words we made, having the humility to 
admit mistakes, not sacrificing others for selfish needs, and many others. I will try my best to do that to earn your trust. I hope you do the same.

*__I understand that work is just a part of life__* â€” I believe most people work to live, not live to work. I do understand some 
people are very passionate about their work and dedicate their lives entirely to it. I respect that, but I'd like to think that that isn't the majority.
If something happens in your life that affects your work, I will try to be understanding and accommodating. I hope to be treated the same. I believe people who are 
fulfilled with their life outside of work are more likely to be better to work with as well. It's a win-win situation for everyone.

*__I believe in async work__* â€” I trust that we are all responsible adults who can manage our own time. Excluding 
synchronous meetings where we are expected to show up, I do not think we need to be online all the time. I believe the asynchronous way
of communicating works better in the long term. When given time to write down our thoughts, we can iterate on them and make them better.
This helps us all to be better communicators and the writing also serves as documentation that we can look back to. 
I am willing to adapt to the team's culture and norms, but where possible, I would prefer async communication. I believe async work also 
helps people achieve a better work-life balance. If you are trying to ask me a question, feel free to include the context and question right in 
the first message! I do not think there is a need to wait for me to respond to your greeting before you ask the question.

*__I assume good intent until you give me reasons to think otherwise__* â€” I do not like to make bad assumptions about people. 
There is no way to know if the assumptions are true and it is not productive to try to find out. I assume you do not 
have malicious intent when working with me until you give me reasons to think otherwise. I hope you do the same for me.
If I have a reasonable basis for doubting your intent, I will be honest and transparent and ask you about it directly.
If I ever do that, the reason is so that we can both clear up any misunderstandings we might have or simply better understand 
the things that make us not work well together.

*__I do not tolerate passive aggressiveness__* â€” If you have reason to be upset with me, I would appreciate it if you could talk to me directly about it.
If I have been a jerk towards you, I apologize sincerely. I would not want us to have reasons to be aggressive towards each other for too long.
It is not healthy for either of us and for the team that we are working with. No one wins.

*__I like to meme__* â€” I like to joke around and meme. I use memes as a way to poke fun at things, but sometimes I do worry that people 
might think I am being passive-aggressive. I do these in good faith and fun spirit; I hope you do not take it the wrong way.

*__I do not usually talk unless asked to__* â€” I am highly introverted. I also do not like to be the one to give unsolicited feedback.
I try to be more proactive in appropriate situations, but in most other cases I just simply do not talk unless asked. Even then, I would 
usually answer the question in a pretty straightforward way. So, yes/no questions aren't the way to get me talking much, but if you ask me 
questions about my opinion on something, I would be more than happy to share. With that being said, I don't generally feel bothered when people ask me questions, so please do not hesitate to ask.

*__I am not afraid to say no__* â€” Do not be afraid to ask me anything. I will try to help when I can, but I will 
also tell you no when I cannot. I like to do this to remove any ambiguity and to set the right expectations. Some people might be
reluctant to ask because they don't want to be a bother. I will tell you directly when it is not a good time for me to help out and 
tell you no, so you don't have to worry about being a bother. I hope you do the same for me.

*__I believe we should try to get better at our work__* â€” I understand that life can get in the way and we might not have the
time to keep up with the latest and greatest. I do not think we can be experts at everything, but we should strive to 
be better compared to our past selves. We might not always improve day-to-day, heck we might even regress at times, but the trend should 
hopefully be moving upwards. I believe that we work better when we want to get better, compared to when we are just doing it for the sake of doing it.

*__I believe helping others is how we make an impact__* â€” I understand there are high-level metrics that businesses usually use to measure impact,
but often I cannot relate to them as easily. OKRs and KPIs can be useful, but the moment they become the only thing that matters, I feel like
it is a sign that things might be going south. I have seen people and teams within the same organization develop a cutthroat culture for the sake of 
KPIs/OKRs and I think it becomes counterproductive. When in doubt, I default to helping others as a way to make an impact. I try to 
think about how I can make things easier for people. Improving processes, writing documentation, and sharing knowledge are some of the ways I try to do that.
At the very least, I try to help others by not being too dependent on them. Instead, I try to be as independent as possible and 
achieve a level where I can start helping others.

*__I appreciate affirmation__* â€” I am not a very confident person. I often second-guess myself and my work. Even though I try
to be upfront with people, I sometimes worry that people might not be honest with me. I appreciate affirmation from the people
I worked with. It helps me to confirm where I have done well and where I can improve. I will try to do the same for you.

## If we are currently working together...

> This section is more specific to my current role. It may change as I switch roles/companies.

*__I believe you are good at what you do__* â€” I have a lot of respect for the hiring process at our company. I believe 
you have the necessary ability to do well in your role. In some cases, we might be given non-trivial tasks that may 
prove to be more complicated. I believe we collectively are well-equipped to solve these. I will try to help as much as I can and I
hope I can count on you to do the same.

*__I care about long-term__* â€” I like our team, I like our company. I want us to be able to work together for a long time.
That does not mean I want to keep the status quo, rather I operate with long-term in mind. Sometimes this means I might be 
more cautious in making decisions. Sometimes this means I might be more nitpicky about things I feel would matter in the long run.
I want to do my part in making our team a place where we are happy to work. I will try to alleviate some of our pain points 
when possible.

*__I might use words that mean something I do not mean__* â€” English isn't my first language. I largely learned it from 
watching TV shows and movies and also reading. A lot of my vocabulary is learned by deriving the meaning from the context.
In some cases, the meaning I derived might not be the same as the actual meaning, causing confusion when I use the phrase with
actual people. If you ever feel confused about what I said, please do not assume that I have any ill intention and ask me to clarify. 
I will try my best to explain and learn the correct meaning for the next time.

*__My work hours can be pretty dynamic__* â€” I sometimes do some of my tasks outside of the usual work hours. Sometimes, I do this when I expect 
I will be busy with other things the next day. Sometimes, I do this just so I can have more downtime the day after. 
I try to keep my work hours balanced and I will take appropriate rest when I need to.

*__I am open to being asked about stuff__* â€” I might not always be able to help, but I will always try to. I am a pretty quiet person and 
do not usually talk unless asked, but it does not mean I despise human interactions. I encourage you to throw me questions if you have 
any and not worry about being a bother. I will tell you straight if it is not a good time or if I cannot help.
