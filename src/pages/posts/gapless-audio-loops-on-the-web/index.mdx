<!--start-->

In July, I built [Tranquil](https://tranquil.vercel.app), a very simple web-app that
allows you to create your own mix of environmental musics. I have always loved the
sounds of nature such as the sound of the rain, wind blowing, etc.

I thought the project would be very simple, I should probably be just able to slap
some `<audio>` elements with `loop="true"`, right? Well, as it turned out, it wasn't that
straightforward.

## The Problem

The following audio embed is created using an `<audio>` element with the `loop` attribute set
to `true`. Try listening to it. Do you notice the problem?

<Audio
  title="Raining sound (loop)"
  src="https://tranquil.vercel.app/audio/rain2.wav"
  loop
/>

Most likely, you heard that the audio stopped abruptly before starting again. This gap makes
the audio loop very annoying to listen to. It is almost like the experience you get when you
watch a YouTube video, and then it buffers for 0.5 second before continuing.

Compare it with this improved version, see if you can notice the difference!
