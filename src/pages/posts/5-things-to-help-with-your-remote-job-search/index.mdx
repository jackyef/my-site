I recently landed my first remote job as a software engineer! üéâ

The past few weeks, some of my friends reached out to ask how I found the job, what I did during the process to land the job, etc. I feel like
this something that more people might be interested in, so I thought I would write about what I learned during the process, and hopefully it will help you too!

-- _Disclaimer_ ‚ö†Ô∏è --

I am by no means a seasoned veteran in remote working. Heck, at the time of this writing
I haven't even started my first remote job yet! üòÇ The point of this writing is to share
the things that I learned during my job search, which might be useful to people 
who are looking to start looking for remote jobs as well.

Before we get into it, let's talk a little about ***why*** you might want to work remotely.

## Why work remotely?

Let's get one thing straight. Working remotely has both its strengths and weaknesses. Depending on what you are looking for,
remote job might not be a good fit for you. Here is my opinion about the pros and cons of working remotely.

### Pros
- **No more commutes**

  Some people might enjoy their daily commutes, but not commuting definitely saves time and energy. Let's say your commute takes 1 hour daily.
  Without it, you now have an extra hour everyday to do other things! You can use it to exercise, cook, meditate, etc.

- **Flexibility**

  Some companies allow you to set your own work hours. This can be very helpful for people who have family/kids to take care of. It is also
  very helpful in general if you need to take care of something in the middle of the day. Do note that some companies might require you
  to be available at a specific time, but it depends on the company.

- **Diversity**
 
  Having the opportunity to work with a whole bunch of different people from around the world is definitely an unique benefit! You can learn
  from people you might not meet normally.

- **Compensation**

  You will be able to have access to compensation packages (that ***might*** be) higher than that of your local market. Note that I said
  ***might***, because every company handles this differently.

### Cons
- **Less face-to-face interactions**
  
  We are social by nature, and typically a lot of our social needs are fulfilled in the office.
  Working remotely reduces that and you probably need to fulfill your social needs through other means. Also, if you are looking for a mentor 
  and you learn more effectively face-to-face, this might not be a great thing for you.

- **Vacation time**

  Depending on where you live, you might end up with less vacation time! One particular example would be if you are living in Indonesia üáÆüá© (like me!). 
  In 2020 alone, we have 16 public holidays! In addition to the standard 12 days of annual leave, that is a total of 28 days of vacations every year! Of course some of the holidays might fall on Saturdays or Sundays, so the effective amount of vacations you are getting might differ.
  Some companies might let you take vacations following your local public holidays though, so make sure you ask them about it.

- **Taxes**

  This is a bit of nitpick, but if the company isn't a legal entity in your country, you are effectively a freelancer/contractor for the company.
  In reality the employment might be full-time in spirit, but legally it would be a contractual employment. I am not familiar with how taxes work 
  in other countries, but in Indonesia, this basically means you would have to handle your own taxes. If you are working at a company that is a 
  legal entity in Indonesia, they usually handle your tax payments for you. You would still need to report your own taxes though using the [1721 A1 
  form](https://www.online-pajak.com/tentang-pajak-pribadi/formulir-1721-a1).


That's it for the pros and cons! There are definitely more but I don't want to get into them too much. As for myself, my primary motivation that
drove me into remote working is the opportunity to work with people from all around the world! I believe having the experience working with different kinds of people would enrich my experience and help me grow.

Now let's get into the 5 things that hopefully will help you in your remote job search!

## 1. Find jobs that interest you
## 2. Work on improving yourself
## 3. Build your portfolio
## 4. Apply for the job!
## 5. Don't beat yourself up
