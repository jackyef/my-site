I often got questions from people who didn't study tech at school/university
wanting to get into tech. This can be someone early in their career, or even
mid-career looking to make a switch.

My honest answer: I honestly don't know! While I do feel like a lot of the
things that I learned was self-taught, I studied informatics at a polytechnic so
I can't and won't pretend that I understand what you're going through.

However, I did quite a bit interviews in the past and I can say that I
personally don't care whether someone is self-taught, mid-career, or whatever.
What I looked for was whether someone would be a valuable addition to the team,
and that's it. I've written <InternalLink href="/thoughts/maximizing-chance-of-getting-a-job-offer">
my thoughts on how to go about maximizing chance of getting a job offer</InternalLink>.

Of course, this does not mean everyone thinks the same way I do. I have heard of
stories of interviewers having personal biases that could either increase/lower
your chance of landing a job. For instance, some people might look down on
bootcamp graduates, but some would actually see it as a strength. In an ideal
world, these non-objective factor shouldn't influence a hiring decision, but
unfortunately we're just not quite there yet.
