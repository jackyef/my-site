          I still worked in the core team, and had more responsibilities
          including but not limited to, planning and implementing various tech
          improvements along with the team.
        </p>
        <p>Some projects that I worked on:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-4 space-y-2">
          <li>
            Migrated our frontend monorepo from Yarn workspace to pnpm. Reduced
            the amount of errors caused by faulty dependency resolutions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pioneered the use of Next.js + Preact for microsites, setting up the
            generator and integrating with existing pipelines. Reduced the
            amount of bytes sent over the wire for microsites.
          </li>
          <li>
            Improved loading performance of Tokopedia svelte-based mobile home
            page. Reduced Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) timing from 4.1s to
            1.7s
          </li>
          <li>
            Improved the build time of staging builds by 90% to enable faster
            development workflows
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          I also had more responsibilities to give talks and share knowledge,
          both internally and externally. In 2020, along with a bunch of
          internal talks (sharing session with other engineers), I gave 2 talks
          at Tokopedia START Summit 2020 and Google&apos;s web.dev ID partners
          forum.

          As of this day, I am no longer part of the Mobile Web team, but rather
          the Web Platform team. This was not a promotion, rather a lateral move
          as a result of the team growing and organizational change that
          happened during this period.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Mobile Web team grew into the Web Platform team, receiving more
          responsibility and ownership over the web platform frontend as a whole
          at Tokopedia. The frontend tech-stack was not at all unified, and
          unifying them was one of the Wen Platform team&apos;s main goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          During these early days, we focused on onboarding new members who
          previously worked full-stack but wanted to specialize in the web
          frontend. We hosted a series of workshops and sharing sessions, while
          also improving the developer tools and infrastructure to make
          developers&apos; life easier.

          Thinking back, I was really happy when this happened, as it is an
          affirmation that I was on the right track. I finally reached a level
          of independence to take care of my own work, while also be capable
          enough to help others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nothing much changed compared to the later days of my previous
          position. But I did have more emphasis on sharing, mentoring,
          researching, and overall owning more responsibilities.

          I joined Tokopedia as a fresh graduate. It was an exciting yet scary
          experience for me. This was my first real job outside of my hometown.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was assigned to the Mobile Web team, which was responsible for...
          well, the Tokopedia&apos;s mobile web. Just like how the iOS and
          Android team focused on building their app, we focused on building the
          mobile web with React.js. We also pioneered the usage of GraphQL at
          Tokopedia, which we developed on Node.js at the time.
        </p>
        <p>
          I remember I felt very poorly equipped to do my job. I didn&apos;t
          have a great grasp on how the web works. I ended up having to ask lots
          of questions to the more senior members of the team on a daily basis.
          I am very grateful that the team were very patient and helpful which
          helped accelerated my growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          During this period, I helped implementing some products and features
          to the mobile web, including:
        </p>
        <Ul>
          <li>TopChat, a chat platform</li>
          <li>TokoPoints, a loyalty points program</li>
          <li>
            Mitra Tokopedia, a partnership program for small mom-and-pop shops
          </li>
          <li>
            Researching possible improvements in general as we are looking to
            solidify our web platform infrastructure
          </li>
        </Ul>
        <p>
          As time went on, I became more and more comfortable with my work. By
          the end of this period I started to be hold my own and also help other
          with their works.
