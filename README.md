## Welcome ðŸ‘‹

This repo contains the code powering [jackyef.com](https://jackyef.com)

The site is powered by:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- ~~[Preact](https://preactjs.com)~~
- [React](https://reactjs.org)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

If you are interested on the thought process of building the site initially, you can read this blog post: [Building a Blog with Next + Preact + Tailwind](https://jackyef.com/posts/building-a-blog-with-next-preact-tailwind)

As I added more stuff to the site, I've gone back to using React as some dependencies I am using aren't compatible with Preact. `radix-ui`, for instance.
